India has been suffering from a lack of trained skill force, very few Indians of working age receive formal vocational education. Which is significantly lower than other countries. Having a high economic growth rate and scarcity of skilled workers the importance of vocational education can not be overlooked. Many of the students do not even know about all the streams available in this sector. And when they get into a institute or get a online course for skill development, they are taught to use tools to do the work. Learning design tools from online resources or an institution to get into the informal sector is easy and there are many resources for all the tools. But there is less importance on how one should approach a problem, the design process. Many who want to start or just started with designing (freelance or hobby) might also come from different backgrounds, so they will not have exposure to design processes. Our goal is to increase awareness of design processes among students getting vocational education.
  
  As a solution we designed a online course website which has courses on various design processes applied in real life projects like web design, logo design, poster design and so on. This course website promotes learning while doing by providing hands on projects to be solved by the learner. This also opens learner's work to be peer reviewed by the other learners on the website and get certification for completing different courses.
